# CodeChallengeCOM
Coding Challenge to create a Python script that discovers and prints available COM ports, creates a virtual COM port pair using a virtual serial port emulator, and establishes two threads to simulate serial data communication between them.
# Virtual Serial Port Communication

This Python script demonstrates virtual serial port communication using the `pyserial` library.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10
- Python 3.10.7
- `pyserial` library (Install via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Virtual serial port emulator (e.g., com0com)

## Setup

1. Download and install the virtual serial port emulator (com0com) from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/).

2. Open the com0com setup tool and create a virtual COM port pair (e.g., COM10 and COM11).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serial-port-communication.git
